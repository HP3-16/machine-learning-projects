# Projects of Machine Learning
Projects I made while learning and experimenting Neural Networks
## Human Action Recognition
- Used various CNN models - Resnet50, VGG16 
## Malaria Detection
- Created a CNN to classify the given images into parasitized and uninfected
## Boston House Price Prediction
- Used Neural Networks whilst implementing k-fold cross validation manually
